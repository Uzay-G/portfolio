Book reviews, my thoughts on the world of literature and even an attempt at writing my own **very** short story.

> Yes; as the music changes,  Like a prismatic glass,  It takes the
light and ranges  Through all the moods that pass;  Dissects the common
carnival  Of passions and regrets,  And gives the world a glimpse of all
The colours it forgets.      
  --Alfred Noyes
