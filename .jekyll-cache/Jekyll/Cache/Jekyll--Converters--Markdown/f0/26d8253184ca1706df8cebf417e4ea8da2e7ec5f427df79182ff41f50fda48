I"u<p>I recently read an article on a website (I can’t find it online) that had an intriguing section named <code class="highlighter-rouge">the attic</code>. It was a collection of all the useful links or resources that the website owner had accumulated and wanted to share with others.</p>

<p>So I decided to add a markdown file to my website with all the useful or interesting things I’ve found online structured by topic.</p>

<p>You can comment down below if you found any of these useful and have any suggestions. Thanks!</p>
