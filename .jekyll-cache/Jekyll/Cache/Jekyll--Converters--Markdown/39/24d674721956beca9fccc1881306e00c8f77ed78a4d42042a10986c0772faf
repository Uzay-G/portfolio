I"u<p>I started at the end of 2019 my work on Devolio, a social community for programmers! I found other online tech communities sometimes too clickbait or dull (Case in point of a post I just found:<em>Top 13 useful JavaScript array tips and tricks you should know</em>) or they were not focused on actual discussion (talking to people about tech is super interesting!).</p>
