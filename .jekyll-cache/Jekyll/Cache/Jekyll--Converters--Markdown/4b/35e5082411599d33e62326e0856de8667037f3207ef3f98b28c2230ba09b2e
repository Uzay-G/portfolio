I"Ì<p>Pragmatic is an efficient and well-designed theme built with Jekyll. It was based off of my portfolio design.</p>

<p>You can learn more about it on its <a href="http://pragmatic.uzpg.me/about">about page.</a></p>

<p>It provides an easy to use structure with built-in projects and post layouts. It adopts SEO best practices and makes configuration and customization so easy.
You can <a href="&quot;http://pragmatic.uzpg.me">buy it</a> or you take a look at <a href="&quot;http://pragmatic.uzpg.me/blog&quot;">its features</a>.</p>

<p>I was inspired to make my own theme after I saw all the amazing templates out there. One I really liked was the <a href="https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/">Moon theme</a></p>
