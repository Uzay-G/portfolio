I"k<p>I’ve been asked quite a few times online for help on creating static sites with generators like jekyll and what are the best ways to host them. So, I have decided to write a series of blog posts that will detail how to fully create, setup and deploy your own <a href="https://scotch.io/bar-talk/5-reasons-static-sites-rock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">static</a> blog built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a>. We will use a customizable theme and for hosting, we’ll go with <a href="https://netlify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a>’s free tier.</p>
