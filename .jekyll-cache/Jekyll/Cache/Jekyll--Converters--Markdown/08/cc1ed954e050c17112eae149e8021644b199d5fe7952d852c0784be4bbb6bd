I"É<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a passionate and young developer/designer that absolutely loves coding and sharing that with others through my blog. I hope you like this minimalist site aimed at those interested in web development and computer science.</p>

<p>Some repositories I love:
<a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll"><img src="https://gh-card.dev/repos/jekyll/jekyll.svg" /></a>
I try my best to create interesting and educative content but Iâ€™m often working on new tools and projects.</p>

<h3 id="lets-work-together">Letâ€™s work together</h3>
<p>I am available for work so donâ€™t hesitate to <a href="#">contact</a> me!</p>
