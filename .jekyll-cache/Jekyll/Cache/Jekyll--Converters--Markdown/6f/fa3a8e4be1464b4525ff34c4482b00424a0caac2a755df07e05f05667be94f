I"#<p>This post is a recap of everything I’ve learned and done in 2019, the progress and learning I’ve accomplished and the projects I was and am building. I’ve included links to all the amazing resources I used to become a better programmer.</p>

<p>This year is the one I truly started programming. It all started on a rainy day in January when I was sitting at my desk with an English assignment. What I had to do was robotically scan a text for <a href="https://literarydevices.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">literary techniques</a> and to be honest, I was downright bored out of my mind. So, although my coding knowledge was <strong>very limited</strong>. I had the idea to build a website that  scan a text and would return all literary techniques so <strong>no one would have to do this again</strong>. And for a novice programmer, that is a <strong>difficult task</strong>. But the fact that I had this motivation is what allowed me to get somewhere with this project. You can view the codebase for the project named Litscan <a href="https://github.com/Uzay-G/Litscan">on Github</a> (keep in mind I was a beginner if you look at it :] ).</p>

<p>Although the project did not get to deployment or production, I am so happy I did it because it sparked my interest in coding and taught me so much! I went from coding static html pages all the way to learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">NLP</a> and building my first webserver.</p>

<p>Working on this and learning about all the components took a bit of time but I then did an internship at <a href="https://www.tweag.io/">Tweag</a>. I was mentored by <a href="https://github.com/mmesch">Matthias Meschede</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aspiwack/">Arnaud Spiwack</a> and I also had the opportunity to learn from <a href="https://github.com/guibou">Guillaume Bouchard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/krisajenkins">Kris Jenkins</a>. They opened my eyes to what it’s like being a professional developer and different paths you can take to become one.</p>

<p>I then started completing the open source <a href="https://theodinproject.com">Odin Project</a> curriculum for web development. It’s an awesome resource built with teh help of volunteers and open source maintainers. I recommend it and I believe it’s one of the best resources to get from zero to hero in webdev. It made me discover Ruby and it’s Rails framework that I love using. It also introduced me to the world of <a href="https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute">open source</a> and developed my knowledge of git.</p>

<p>As a part of this curriculum, I followed Michael Hartl’s in-depth <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-4th-edition-tutorial/beginning">Ruby On Rails tutorial</a>. Once again, I decided to apply the methods of <a href="https://www.pblworks.org/what-is-pbl">project based learning</a>. Instead of building the sample app of the book, I decided to follow the same outline but instead build <a href="http://metadigest.uzpg.me?ref=blog">Metadigest</a>. Metadigest is a newsletter I built in Rails that scrapes different APIs to get the the most popular tech content for the week. I then curate these articles and send the digest! Through this, I learned about encryption, api requests and also how to setup a production rails website with an AWS ec2 container.</p>

<p>Flash forward to now, I’m learning a lot about computer science, hacking and AI with these great resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ebookfoundation.github.io/free-programming-books/">Free Programming Books</a>, a collection of amazing programming books for pretty much everything.</li>
  <li><a href="https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/">Tech Interview Handbook</a>, tips and tricks to hack your coding interview</li>
  <li><a href="https://elementsofai.com">Hacker101</a>, a great free intro to hacking.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.hackerone.com/hacker101">Elements of AI</a>, an open MOOC introducing people to AI built by the Swedish government.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I learn with this free content, I am also beginning to work on Devolio, an open platform for developers to share, discuss and create. This is my biggest project for now as I want to let users customize their profile design with css and am building an API for users to integrate with Devolio in their own creative projects.</p>

<p>I haven’t launched yet, but you can check out the landing page at:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.devol.io/?ref=blog">http://www.devol.io</a>
And if that doesn’t work because I am having problems with ssl:</li>
  <li><a href="https://devol-io.herokuapp.com/?ref=blog">https://devol-io.herokuapp.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I’m really excited about this website because I think it can become something really interesting and I might open source it if there is enough interest and I can sustain myself.</p>

<p>I’m also thrilled to have built my tech blog which you are reading through right now and to have written 11 articles in the last 5 months.</p>

<p>I know that working on the Devolio platform while being a student is going to take up a big part of my time but I look forward to developing this project and making it something useful. I also want to get better at Rust with this <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html">book</a> and progress on the <a href="https://elementsofai.com">elements of ai course</a>.</p>
