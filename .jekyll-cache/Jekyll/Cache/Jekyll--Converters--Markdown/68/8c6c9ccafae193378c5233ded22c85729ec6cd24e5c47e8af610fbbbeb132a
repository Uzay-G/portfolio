<p>I started at the end of 2019 my work on <a href="https://www.devol.io">Devolio</a>, a social community for programmers! I found other alternatives sometimes too clickbait or dull (I just found this post:<em>Top 13 useful JavaScript array tips and tricks you should know</em>) or they were not focused on actual discussion (talking to people about tech is super interesting!).</p>

<p>So I want to build this platform for programmers to share and engage with other fellow coders.
I am building this with a Rails backend and the only JS framework I am using is Jquery (outdated stack but it works). All this will be hosted on Heroku for now but I will switch to more scalable alternatives later.</p>

<p>I am really excited about the different features I am working on to make my project fun for me to build and for other hackers to use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CSS customization (think MySpace) secured with this <a href="https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize">great gem</a> (<a href="">CSS can be dangerous!</a>)</li>
  <li>public and open API with documentation (opens up avenues for data analysis and tons of interesting projects)</li>
  <li>open source collaboration possibilities (creating a friendly environment to build a hopefully awesome project)</li>
  <li>markdown everywhere</li>
</ul>
