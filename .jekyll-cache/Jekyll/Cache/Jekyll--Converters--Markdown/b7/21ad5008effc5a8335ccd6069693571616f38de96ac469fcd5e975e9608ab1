I"ã<p>I started at the end of 2019 my work on <a href="https://www.devol.io">Devolio</a>, a social community for programmers! I found other alternatives sometimes too clickbait and dull (<em>Top 13 useful JavaScript array tips and tricks you should know</em>) or they were not focused enough on actual discussion (talking to other tech nerds people is super interesting!).</p>

<p>So I want to build this platform for programmers to share and get better at what they do best: code!</p>
