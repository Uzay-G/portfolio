I"¯<p>I recently read an article on a website (I canâ€™t find it online) that had an intriguing section named <code class="highlighter-rouge">the attic</code>. It was a collection of all the useful links or resources that the website owner had accumulated and wanted to share with others.</p>

<p>So I decided to add a markdown file to my website with all the useful or interesting things Iâ€™ve found online structured by topic.</p>
