I"Ë<p>This article is a collection of the little features and design aspects Iâ€™ve noticed are becoming more and more prominent in web design. Iâ€™ve also included beautiful examples and links to tutorials where you can learn how to replicate these patterns.</p>

<h2 id="scrolling-effects">Scrolling Effects</h2>
<p>There are several scrolling effects becoming more and more popular. One of them which is appealing but a bit over-used is when content fades into view as you scroll. You can see examples <a href="https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. I think these are interesting and I even have them on my site but understand why people might say they are becoming a bit repetitive.</p>

<p>Another scroll effect is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp">parallax scrolling</a>. Honestly, I donâ€™t really appreciate this one but itâ€™s becoming more and more ubiquitous. Itâ€™s a technique where the background images scroll down slower than the main page content to create a sensation of depth on the two-dimensional website.
I think it can be done <a href="https://davideperozzi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well</a> but sometimes I feel it doesnâ€™t add anything to the UI.</p>

I truly recommend you check this one out because it uses scrolling to provide a very unique and interesting UX.</p>

<h2 id="webgl-and-3d-graphics">WebGL and 3D graphics</h2>
<p>Now I am really excited about these type of effects because they can result in amazing and original websites from creative people. Although WebGL is used for web game development it can also be useful for design. 
This is becoming more and more popular as technologies like <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three.js</a> are more and more sophisticated and WebGL becomes less of a hassle for the developer.</p>

<h2 id="skeleton-loaders-and-preloaders">Skeleton Loaders and preloaders</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s often useful to display placeholder content while your data-heavy images or embeds are loading. New techniques like skeleton screens and spinners have become the go-to solution to deal with these problems. 
They let the user know that something is going on behind the screen and they arenâ€™t staring at a dead website.
If you want to learn how to code and design a loader, you should check out <a href="http://uzpg.me/2019/09/22/design-preloader.html">this post</a>. This is what should have by the end of the tutorial:</p>
<pre><code>

<div id="loader">
  <div id="uno" class="circles"></div>
  <div id="dos" class="circles"></div>
  <div id="tres" class="circles"></div>
</div>
<div id="content">
</div>
</code></pre>
<p>Skeleton screens are a different approach to this problem, but you can learn more about how to build them with CSS with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/building-skeleton-screens-css-custom-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this useful article from CSS tricks.</a></p>

<h2 id="colorful-vector-illustrations">Colorful Vector Illustrations</h2>
<p>These svg illustrations are stunning. They truly embellish the website and add a lot to a websiteâ€™s clean, sleek design. You can even get them for free now at awesome websites like <a href="https://illlustrations.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illlustrations.co</a> and even customizable ones at <a href="https://undraw.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Undraw.</a>

<h2 id="minimalism">Minimalism</h2>
<p>Minimalist websites are hard to pull off. These are simple yet well put together websites that have a sleek user interface and a good flow. From a small set of elements, the best minimalist websites should have an entrancing yet practical webdesign. <strong>Careful!</strong> Minimalists websites should not be confused with text-only sites. If you enjoy text-only here are a few that originated on a hilarious reddit thread (I recommend that you view them in order):</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bestmotherfucking.website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bestmotherfucking.website/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To finish this article, here are some appealing websites and portfolios Iâ€™ve found the last year:</p>
