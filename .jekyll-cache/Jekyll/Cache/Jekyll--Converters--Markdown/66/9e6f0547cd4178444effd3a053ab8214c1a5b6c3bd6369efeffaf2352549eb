I"Œ<p>I started at the end of 2019 my work on <a href="https://www.devol.io">Devolio</a>, a social community for programmers! I found other alternatives sometimes too clickbait or dull (I just found this post:<em>Top 13 useful JavaScript array tips and tricks you should know</em>) or they were not focused enough on actual discussion (talking to other tech nerds people is super interesting!).</p>
