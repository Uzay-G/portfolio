Prismalytics is a web application and a set of client-side libraries that allow you to gather analytics about how your bots are being used.

The API that gathers this data is built in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), a nascent language based on ruby that is compiled. I used the crystal [amber framework](https://amberframework.org/).

Users and I have also built a few client-side libraries for efficient integration with your bots:

- [Prisma.py](https://github.com/Uzay-G/prisma.py)
- [Prismarb](https://github.com/Uzay-G/prismarb/)
- [Prismajs](https://github.com/diogoscf/prismajs)

I'm very excited about this first project in crystal!
