Metadigest is a newsletter that collects links from popular text sites which are then curated and delivered to your inbox every week. It's algorithm sorts through these articles and selects the best and most relevant ones

An automated newsletter that fetches the best content from different tech communities and delivers it to your mailbox.


This project taught me a lot about:

- interacting with web apis and webscraping
- using Rails Passenger with Nginx to host my service on a VPS
- configuring my own mail server with Postfix to send quality newsletters
