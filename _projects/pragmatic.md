Pragmatic is an efficient and well-designed theme built with Jekyll. It was based off of my portfolio design.

You can learn more about it on its <a href="http://pragmatic.uzpg.me/about">about page.</a>

It provides an easy to use structure with built-in projects and post layouts. It adopts SEO best practices and makes configuration and customization so easy.

I was inspired to make my own theme after I saw all the amazing templates out there. One I really liked was the [Moon theme](https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/)
