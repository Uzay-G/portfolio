<h1>About Me</h1>

I am a passionate and young developer/designer that absolutely loves coding and sharing that with others through my blog. I hope you like this minimalist site aimed at those interested in web development and computer science.

Some repositories I love:
<div id="git-container">

<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask"><img src="https://gh-card.dev/repos/pallets/flask.svg"></a>
<a href="https://github.com/explosion/spacy"><img src="https://gh-card.dev/repos/explosion/spacy.svg"></a>
<a href="https://github.com/sass/sass"><img src="https://gh-card.dev/repos/sass/sass.svg"></a>
<a href="https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk"><img src="https://gh-card.dev/repos/gitalk/gitalk.svg"></a>
<a href="https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js"><img src="https://gh-card.dev/repos/highlightjs/highlight.js.svg"></a>
</div>

I try my best to create interesting and educative content but I'm often working on new tools and projects.

### Let's work together
I am available for work so don't hesitate to <a href="#">contact</a> me!
