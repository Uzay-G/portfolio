<h1>About Me</h1>

I am a passionate student learning computer science, and mathematics (also dabbling in physics). I use this site as a portfolio / blog where I share my interests and thoughts on both science and literature. 

You can also learn more about me through my [wiki](https://knowledge.uzpg.me).

Notably maintainer of [Archivy](https://archivy.github.io) and lead developer of [AdiosCorona](https://adioscorona.org).
