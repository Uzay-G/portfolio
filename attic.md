title: The Attic
---

I recently read an article on a website (I can't find it online) that had an intriguing section named `the attic`. It was a collection of all the useful links or resources that the website owner had accumulated and wanted to share with others.

So I decided to add a markdown file to my website with all the useful or interesting things I've found online ordered by topic.
All the resources included are totally free and I plan to add many more links and content as I learn more and explore new hidden corners of the internet!

You can comment down below if you found any of these useful and have any suggestions. Thanks!
