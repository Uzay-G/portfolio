title: The Attic
---

I recently read an article on a website (I can't find it online) that had an intriguing section named `the attic`. It was a collection of all the useful links or resources that the website owner had accumulated and wanted to share with others.

So I decided to add a markdown file to my website with all the useful or interesting things I've found online structured by topic.

You can comment down below if you found any of these useful and have any suggestions. Thanks!
